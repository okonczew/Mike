# Fixing SEO of website

One of the projects that I had to prepare for my Web Developer path at Openclassrooms. 

My job was to analyze Mike's website (he's a freelance web designer from Atlanta) and offer SEO suggestions that would increase  the chances that his website will appear at the top of search engine results when someone searches "freelance web designer Atlanta".

My task was to:
1) Analyze the provided website's state of SEO and accessibility.
2) Make 10 recommendations to improve website's SEO and/or accesibility
3) Apply your recommendations to the code.
4) Provide a before-and-after comparison of the two websites to show that my adjustments made the website faster
