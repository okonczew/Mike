# Fixing SEO of website

One of the projects that I had to prepare for my Web Developer path at Openclassrooms. 

My job was to analyze Mike's website (he's a freelance web designer from Atlanta) and offer SEO suggestions that would increase  the chances that his website will appear at the top of search engine results when someone searches "freelance web designer Atlanta".

My task was to:
1) Analyze the provided website's state of SEO and accessibility.
2) Make 10 recommendations to improve website's SEO and/or accesibility
3) Apply your recommendations to the code.
4) Provide a before-and-after comparison of the two websites to show that my adjustments made the website faster



10 Recommendations to improve website's SEO:

1. Resizing the photos. I would defintely recommend changing the size of one photo file - „atlanta made sign orange.jpg” has 9600x5400 px and it's the main reason why website gets laggy while scrolling. Changing the resolution of this photo to 1920x1080 px will keep the good photo quality and at the same time eliminate lagging problem.
2. <title> tag has a . as a content. Since it's the most crucial tag in SEO positioning I would add here some keywords or a whole phrase that we try to rank for. For this matter I suggest adding „Mike | freelance web designer from Atlanta”.
3. Content in <meta name=”keywords”> is empty - it needs to be filled with some keywords. I suggest adding keywords such as: best, freelance web designer, Atlanta, design, web designer, web design”.
4. <meta name=”descrption”> tag has a content: „I'm Mike and your should hire me to build your website”. This phrase has a spelling mistake (avoid those if you want to make good and professional impression on your potential clients) and doesn't have the main keywords that we want to rank for, meaning „freelance web designer Atlanta”.
That's why I suggest changing it to „I'm a freelance web designer from Atlanta, passionate about graphic and web design”.
5. HTML code has more than one h1. We need to keep only one <h1> and change rest of them for, for example <h2>. I would keep the <h1> in the header part of the website - currently is has the content saying „I'm Mike”. I suggest changing it to „I'm Mike, freelance web designer from Atlanta” - this sentence has a whole phrase that we try to rank for.
6. h2 and p should have keywords or their synonyms. For example in most cases I would go for a phrase „web designer” instead of „website designer”, because it is more searched one according to KWFinder (service that helps speed up the process by calculation the amount of competition for keywords). Also I would suggest not to put same word several times in one sentence – I understand that Mike is trying to rank for certain keywords, but content of the website should be easy to follow and sound natural. For this matter I would for example change the sentence „I love Atlanta, my hometown, and want to see all Atlanta businesses succeed” to „I love Atlanta, and want to see all my hometown businesses succeed”
7. nav has an empty li tag. I would remove all the tags that are not used in any way.
8. 2nd navigation li is named „page2” – this name is also displayed on the web. I would change the name to „Contact”. „Page2” has no meaning for a reader, it doesn't say what is this page about.
9. Portfolio includes 4 pictures, but only one has an alt element (which anyway doesn't describe the content of the photo – alt=”3.jpg”). I suggest adding alt atributes to the rest of the photos and putting keywords in their descriptions wherever appropriate.
10. Mike's website is using minified versions of jquery, bootstrap and font-awesome. Changing those to CDN links will increase loading speed of a website.
